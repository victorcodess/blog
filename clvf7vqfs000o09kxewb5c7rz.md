Have you ever felt overwhelmed integrating the Google Maps API into a React project for the first time? Well, I definitely have! Choosing the right library can be daunting, especially when you need specific features like dynamic markers and location search.

In this article, weâ€™ll see a simple example of how to integrate Google Maps into a React project. However, weâ€™ll start by discussing why you might want to do so and some advanced Google Maps features you can use. If you prefer, you can jump ahead to the tutorial â€” make sure to check out the demo projectâ€™s [source code](https://github.com/victorcodess/react-google-maps-demo) as well.

## Using Google Maps in React

There are a number of reasons why you may choose to integrate Google Maps into your React app. Weâ€™ll be taking a look at one of the most popular ones. You can use them as a base for other, more complex cases if you desire.

* **Enhanced User Experience (UX):** Google Maps is a familiar and user-friendly platform for visualizing locations. Integrating it into your React app allows users to easily explore geographical data, navigate places of interest, and understand spatial relationships.
    
* **Location-based Functionality:** Google Maps unlocks a wide range of location-based functionalities for your React app. You can display user locations, track deliveries, visualize sales data on a map to identify trends, or even create real-time route planning and navigation features.
    
* **Increased Engagement:** Interactive maps are inherently engaging. Users can zoom in and out, explore different map views, and discover new information. This interactivity can keep users engaged with your application for longer periods.
    
* **Data Visualization:** Google Maps can be a powerful tool for data visualization. You can use markers, heatmaps, and polylines to represent various types of data on a map, allowing users to gain valuable insights from geographical patterns.
    

## React Google Maps

For React developers, like myself, seeking a first-party solution for integrating Google Maps, the `vis.gl/react-google-maps` library stands out as a compelling choice. This official offering from the Google Maps Platform team simplifies the process of adding interactive maps to your React application.

It was first provisioned by the Google Maps Platform team, in order to provide solid integrations between React and the Maps JavaScript API. The design of `vis.gl/react-google-maps` draws inspiration from the successful integration between `react-map-gl` and the map renderers based on `mapbox-gl-js`.

It's important to note that `vis.gl/react-google-maps` requires a valid Google Maps Platform API key for functionality. Additionally, while the library offers a decent set of core components, developers may need to interact directly with the underlying Google Maps JavaScript API for more advanced use cases.

Although `vis.gl/react-google-maps` is a compelling choice for integrating Google Maps with React, it's important to acknowledge that other popular libraries exist. One such alternative is `google-maps-react`, offering a familiar approach for developers accustomed to working with Google Maps APIs.

Regardless of which library you select, make sure it aligns with your project's requirements and your development preferences. In this article, we'll focus on utilizing `vis.gl/react-google-maps` for consistency.

## Get Started

**Prerequisites:**

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.

<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">ðŸ’¡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">For this walkthrough, we'll be creating a React project using Vite and Tailwind CSS for styling. While these are my preferred choices, you can absolutely tailor the setup to your existing project or preferences.</div>
</div>

**Project Setup:**

1. **Create a React project with Vite:**
    
    ```plaintext
    npm create vite@latest react-google-maps-demo -- --template react-ts
    cd react-google-maps-demo
    ```
    
    This command creates a new React project with TypeScript support using Vite, a modern build tool.
    
2. **Install Dependencies:**
    
    ```plaintext
    npm install @vis.gl/react-google-maps
    ```
    
    This installs the `@vis.gl/react-google-maps` library, allowing you to integrate Google Maps into your React application. This module comes with full TypeScript-support out of the box, so no additional module is required for the typings.
    
3. **(Optional) Install Tailwind CSS:**
    
    ```plaintext
    npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    npx tailwindcss init -p
    ```
    
    If you plan to use Tailwind CSS for styling, [follow these steps](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite) to install and configure it. Remember to configure your Tailwind configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) according to your project's needs.
    
4. Start the development server:
    
    ```plaintext
    npm run dev
    ```
    
    This command starts the development server and opens your application in the browser:

## Obtaining Google Maps API key

To utilize Google Maps functionality within your React application, you'll need to obtain an [API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) from the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). They have several APIâ€™s to use with the Maps API but for now, weâ€™ll need just the `Maps Javascript API` to get started for the map. So ensure that the `Maps Javascript API` is enabled in your console.

**Steps to Acquire an API Key:**

1. **Create or Access a GCP Project:** If you don't have an existing project, create one on the GCP Console ([https://cloud.google.com/).](https://cloud.google.com/)
    
2. **Enable Required APIs:** Navigate to the "APIs & Services" section in the GCP Console and enable the following APIs for your project:
    
    * **Maps JavaScript API**
        
3. **Create an API Key:** In the "Credentials" section of the GCP Console, create a new API key. Consider restricting this key to only allow usage for your specific project for better security.
    

**Never commit your API key to a public repository** like Github. Instead, create a `.env.local` file in your project's root directory and add the following line, replacing `<your API key here>` with your actual key:

```typescript
VITE_REACT_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=<your API key here>
```

## **Displaying a Basic Map**

In this section, I'll walk you through rendering a simple Google Map in your React application using `vis.gl/react-google-maps`.

1. **Import Necessary Components:**
    
    ```typescript
    import { APIProvider, Map } from '@vis.gl/react-google-maps';
    ```
    
    We import the `APIProvider` and `Map` components from the library.
    
2. **Set Up the**`App`**Component:**
    
    ```typescript
    const App = () => (
      <APIProvider apiKey={import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY}>
        <Map
          style={{ width: '100vw', height: '100vh' }}
          defaultCenter={{ lat: 22.54992, lng: 0 }}
          defaultZoom={3}
          gestureHandling={'greedy'}
          disableDefaultUI={true}
        />
      </APIProvider>
    );
    export default App;
    ```
    
    * The `APIProvider` component wraps the `Map` component and provides the necessary context and functionality for using Google Maps within your React application. It requires your API key as a prop.
        
    * The `Map` component itself defines the map element. We configure its appearance and behavior using props:
        
        * `style`: Sets the width and height of the map container.
            
        * `defaultCenter`: Specifies the initial location of the map using latitude and longitude coordinates (here, centered near the equator).
            
        * `defaultZoom`: Defines the initial zoom level (a higher value represents a closer view).
            
        * `gestureHandling`: Controls how the map interacts with user gestures like touch or panning. Here, `'greedy'` prioritizes map interactions over page scrolling.
            
        * `disableDefaultUI`: Removes the default user interface elements provided by Google Maps (zoom controls, map type options, etc.).
            
3. **View the Map:**
    
    With these components in place, our application should render a basic interactive map.

## **Adding InfoWindows and Markers**

### InfoWindows

The `InfoWindow` component is a part of the Google Maps API provided by the `@vis.gl/react-google-maps` package, which allows you to create information windows on the map. Information windows are pop-up windows that appear above the map at a specific location and provide additional information about a particular point of interest.

The `InfoWindow` component is used as a child component within the `Map` component. It takes several props, but the most important one is `position`, which specifies the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) where the info window should be displayed on the map.

The code snippet below demonstrates how to add an `InfoWindow` with the content "Hello World!" positioned at specific coordinates:

```typescript
import { APIProvider, InfoWindow, Map } from "@vis.gl/react-google-maps";

const App = () => (
  <APIProvider apiKey={import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY}>
    <Map
      style={{ width: "100vw", height: "100vh" }}
      defaultCenter={{ lat: 53.54992, lng: 10.00678 }}
      defaultZoom={13}
      gestureHandling={"greedy"}
      disableDefaultUI={true}
    >
      <InfoWindow position={{ lat: 53.54992, lng: 10.00678 }}>
        Hello World!
      </InfoWindow>
    </Map>
  </APIProvider>
);

export default App;
```

With these components in place, our application should render a map with an information window saying "Hello World!".

### Marker

The `Marker` component is a part of the Google Maps API provided by the `@`[`vis.gl/react-google-maps`](http://vis.gl/react-google-maps) package, enabling you to place markers on the map to indicate specific points of interest or locations.

While `InfoWindows` provide details, markers visually represent points of interest on the map. You can use the `Marker` component from `visgl/react-google-maps` to add markers. The usage is similar to `InfoWindows`, with a `position` prop and optional customization options like icons.

The code snippet below demonstrates adding a basic marker at specific coordinates:

```typescript
import { APIProvider, Map, Marker } from "@vis.gl/react-google-maps";

const App = () => (
  <APIProvider apiKey={import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY}>
    <Map
      style={{ width: "100vw", height: "100vh" }}
      defaultCenter={{ lat: 53.54992, lng: 10.00678 }}
      defaultZoom={12}
      gestureHandling={"greedy"}
      disableDefaultUI={true}
    >
      <Marker position={{ lat: 53.54992, lng: 10.00678 }} />
    </Map>
  </APIProvider>
);

export default App;
```

With our components in place, our application should render a map with a single marker. We can also render multiple markers if we need.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1713862252832/da979ef9-cf2f-487c-a853-8367aae052e7.png align="center")

### Advanced Markers

The `AdvancedMarker` component provides a more customizable alternative to the standard `Marker` component.

The `AdvancedMarker` component allows for extensive customization of the marker's appearance and behavior. Developers can apply custom styles, including complex layouts, backgrounds, borders, and shadows, to the marker using JSX/TSX, CSS classes or inline styles.

To use the `AdvancedMarker` component, it is necessary to add a custom `mapId` to the map options. The `mapId` prop in the `Map` component specifies the ID of the Google Map being rendered. This prop is particularly useful when working with styled maps or when multiple maps are present on the same page.

This example renders an `AdvancedMarker` with custom styles and an SVG element:

```typescript
import { APIProvider, AdvancedMarker, Map } from "@vis.gl/react-google-maps";

const App = () => (
  <APIProvider apiKey={import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY}>
    <Map
      style={{ width: "100vw", height: "100vh" }}
      defaultCenter={{ lat: 53.54992, lng: 10.00678 }}
      defaultZoom={12}
      gestureHandling={"greedy"}
      disableDefaultUI={true}
      mapId={import.meta.env.VITE_MAP_ID}
    >
      <AdvancedMarker
        position={{ lat: 53.54992, lng: 10.00678 }}
        className="w-[250px] bg-white flex flex-col items-center gap-1 py-3 px-3 rounded-xl shadow-xl"
      >
        <h2 className="text-[20px] font-medium">I am so customized</h2>
        <p>That is pretty awesome!</p>

        <svg
          className="absolute text-white h-10 w-full left-0 top-full"
          x="0px"
          y="0px"
          viewBox="0 0 255 255"
          xmlSpace="preserve"
        >
          <polygon
            className="fill-current shadow-lg"
            points="0,0 127.5,127.5 255,0"
          />
        </svg>
      </AdvancedMarker>
    </Map>
  </APIProvider>
);

export default App;
```

The result should look like this:

## React Google Maps Hooks

The `useMap()` and `useMapLibrary()` hooks are part of the `vis.gl/react-google-maps` package, which provides React hooks for integrating Google Maps functionality into a React application.

### **useMap()**

The `useMap()` hook allows you to access and interact with the Google Map instance within your React component. It provides a way to interact with the map programmatically, such as changing the map's center, zoom level, or adding markers dynamically.

#### **Example Usage:**

```typescript
import { useMap, APIProvider, Map } from '@vis.gl/react-google-maps';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const map = useMap();

  // Access and manipulate the map instance
  useEffect(() => {
    // Set the map's center and zoom level
    map.setCenter({ lat: 53.54992, lng: 10.00678 });
    map.setZoom(12);
  }, [map]);

  return (
    <APIProvider apiKey={import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY}>
     <Map
       style={{ width: '100vw', height: '100vh' }}
       gestureHandling={'greedy'}
       disableDefaultUI={true}
     />
   </APIProvider>
  );
};
```

### **useMapLibrary()**

The `useMapLibrary()` hook allows you to access additional libraries provided by the Google Maps JavaScript API, such as the Places API, Geoloction API, e.t.c. It provides a way to load and use these libraries dynamically within your React component.

#### **Example Usage:**

```typescript
import { useMap, APIProvider, Map } from '@vis.gl/react-google-maps';

const MyComponent = () => {
  // triggers loading the places library and returns true once complete (the
  // component calling the hook gets automatically re-rendered when this is
  // the case)
  const map = useMap();
  const placesLib = useMapsLibrary('places');
  const [placesService, setPlacesService] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!placesLib || !map) return;

    setPlacesService(new placesLib.PlacesService(map));
  }, [placesLib, map]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!placesService) return;

    // ...use placesService...
  }, [placesService]);

  return (
    <APIProvider apiKey={import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY}>
     <Map
       style={{ width: '100vw', height: '100vh' }}
       gestureHandling={'greedy'}
       disableDefaultUI={true}
     />
   </APIProvider>
  );
};
```
